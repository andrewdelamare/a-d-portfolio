          I'm a software developer located in Jyv채skyl채, Finland.

          I like collaborating, being part of a team, and making things happen. 
          I have experience with front end technologies and frameworks including React and Redux,
          as well as experience with some back end tech, and I'm very interested in modern full stack development.
          I'm especially interested in open source,
