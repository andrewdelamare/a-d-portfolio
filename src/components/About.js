            I'm a software developer located in Jyv채skyl채, Finland. I'm a self
            taught developer with a background in Scottish and English law. I
            started programing in 2021 after moving from the San Francisco bay
            area to Jyv채skyl채.

            I like collaborating, being part of a team, and making things
            happen. I have experience with front end technologies and frameworks
            including React and Redux, as well as experience with some back end
            tech, and I'm very interested in modern full stack development. In
            2022 I took part in the Helsinki University Full Stack MOOC, which
            was my first introduction to full stack development. I am currently
            focused on growing and continuing my journey as a full stack
            developer.
